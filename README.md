# Urban Luxe - E-Commerce Apparel Store

This is a fictional e-commerce apparel website project designed to enhance and refine my front-end development skills. The project's goal was to create a fully functional and aesthetically pleasing online store from scratch, leveraging frameworks like Next.js and React with as minimal libraries as possible.

### Features

- Simulates a real-world project by using mock data and implementing backend logic to handle user interactions and data processing
- User-friendly product search and filtering functionality
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices
- Smooth animations and transitions for enhanced user experience
- Effective state management by utilizing local browser storage and context APIs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/ecdevv/Apparel-E-Commerce.git
2. Navigate into the repository:
      cd /your_directory/apparel-e-commerce
3. Install Dependencies:
      npm install
4. Run the app:
      npm start or npm run dev

## Notes/Potential Improvements/Known Issues

- Improve the emphasis on user actions such as adding products to a shopping cart or signing up for a newsletter.
- Consider adding more visual elements to various pages such as sliders or showcases for a better user experience. 
  - The current simplicity of the front page, for example, makes it a good starting point, but there's room for more engaging and interactive elements.
  - Product page could definitely use something like a review section.
- Could add additional headers/navigation to store and product pages.
- On the Store page, the transitions on the filter menu are buggy on Firefox.
- On the Product page, real products would likely be using lighter and more consistent backgrounds for images, which would allow for the dark border on selected options to stand out more.
- Mock data may not be the most scalable and should likely be split into different schemas/tables.
- A lot of logic can definitely be done more optimally and efficiently.
- I tried to make everything reusable and from scratch; I only used two libraries: react-transition-group and react-swipables (for mobile swiping).
- Collections do not do anything and just relink to the homepage.
